        <p>Madrid, Spain's vibrant capital, is known for its rich history and culture and its growing specialty coffee scene. Here's a quick guide to some of the best cafes in the city for digital nomads.</p>

        <p>We begin our journey in the elegant Salamanca neighborhood, home to Hola Coffee. This cozy spot is perfect for coffee lovers seeking quality. The menu offers various options, from classic espressos to innovative brewing methods. The calm atmosphere makes it an ideal place for reading or working, although it isn't specifically labeled as digital-nomad-friendly.</p>

        <p>Next, head to the city center, where several excellent cafes are concentrated. Pum Pum Café on Tribulete Street is a charming little place serving specialty coffee and delicious homemade pastries. This spot is digital-nomad-friendly, with available outlets and reliable Wi-Fi. Nearby on Cost.ª de los ángeles 7, you'll find Hanso Café 2, known for its scientific approach to coffee brewing. Hanso offers a quiet atmosphere and free Wi-Fi, although outlets may be scarce during peak hours.</p>

        <p>La Casa Encendida's café on Ronda de Valencia is another must-visit. Located in a cultural center, it provides a unique space to enjoy coffee while exploring exhibitions. The spacious area has free Wi-Fi but can get crowded due to its prime location. If you're a coffee aficionado, Acid Coffee on Verónica Street features quality beans and a relaxed setting. It’s a comfortable spot to work or read, with free Wi-Fi and available outlets.</p>

        <p>In the Chamberí neighborhood, Toma Café is a benchmark in Madrid's specialty coffee scene. Their commitment to quality and sustainability is evident in every cup. Toma is another great place for digital nomads, with free Wi-Fi and outlets, though it can be busy during peak hours. Finally, in Arganzuela, Dot Café Bar offers a unique experience combining specialty coffee with contemporary art. The spacious and bright venue has free Wi-Fi, but outlets can be limited.</p>

        <p>Note: Some cafes may restrict computer use on weekends to maintain a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere for all patrons.</p>
