            <p>Nestled in the heart of Malasaña, Bianchi Kiosko Caffé offers a unique blend of Ethiopian, Brazilian, and Guatemalan coffees. The shop emphasizes takeaway, though a few window-side seats are available for those who want to enjoy coffee while people-watching in this vibrant neighborhood.</p>
            
            <p>For a fusion of coffee and culture, visit Faraday, a café and record store hybrid. Located on San Lucas Street, it’s perfect for a quick coffee while browsing vinyl records. With only a handful of seats, Faraday is best suited for grab-and-go orders.</p>
