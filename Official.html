        <section id="purpose" class="section">
            <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
            <p>At OFFicial, we are a vital ally for people who are forced to leave behind their homes, lives, and everything they know and face precarious conditions upon arriving in a new country. In an interconnected and technologically advanced world, our mission is to support and empower these individuals who are constantly pursuing a dignified and secure life.</p>
            <h3>What do we do?</h3>
            <p>We use innovation and prospective design to create future-oriented artifacts that promote collective reflection and drive social change. We transform refugees' complex realities, projecting effective solutions for the near future. Our approach focuses on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Simplification:</strong> We significantly reduce the processing times for asylum applications through deeply empathetic and human interactions.</li>
                <li><strong>Automation:</strong> We alleviate the administrative burden on institutions and streamline processes by integrating advanced intelligent technologies.</li>
                <li><strong>Facilitating Integration:</strong> We build bridges of support that enable agile and meaningful integration into host communities, providing services that interpret and assist refugees at every step.</li>
                <li><strong>Building Trust:</strong> In a constantly changing global environment, we offer clarity and eliminate uncertainty for refugees, ensuring a secure and understandable experience.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Look & Feel</h3>
            <p>The development of the graphic elements that make up Welcome is based on two fundamental guidelines: the design principles by which OFFicial operates and the work developed by Syrian graphic designer and refugee Yara Said.</p>
            <p>In 2015, the civil war in Syria, the situation of extreme poverty in Niger, and the political persecution in Afghanistan and Iraq led to one of the largest migration crises in history. As a result, the Rio 2016 Olympic Games joined Amnesty International's Refugee Nation initiative. They registered a team of 10 refugee athletes as a symbolic gesture to make the crisis visible. This initiative has been continued for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics with a team of 29 athletes.</p>
            <p>Although not officially recognized by the International Olympic Committee, as part of this visibility campaign, a team of creatives developed several distinctive graphic elements, the most important of which is the Refugee Nation flag.</p>

                <blockquote>"Deeply convinced that design and technology should serve communication between people, and not the other way around, and with a life trajectory in community organizations, we create Welcome to impact, facilitate, and streamline the management of situations of vulnerability, particularly in the asylum application process for refugees by the principles of the Geneva Convention."</blockquote>

Currently, she focuses on creating and managing communities, organizing events and meetups to attract opportunities, and establishing relationships with key players in the design sector.</p>
                <blockquote>"I believe in design as a tool to move forward, and through my work, I feel obligated to respond to any stimulus that arises from observing situations or needs, using the natural user experience-based design process. I believe designers have that superpower and that creativity and empathy are our greatest allies in addressing it."</blockquote>

                <blockquote>"Due to my personal interest in social issues, particularly those affecting vulnerable populations, and my academic background as a Sociologist, the personal purpose of this project is to understand, from my perspective as a foreigner in Spain, the life stories, needs, and challenges of refugees in Spain. I seek to empathize with them and find possible solutions from my place in society and as part of the OFFicial team."</blockquote>
