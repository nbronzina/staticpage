            <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
            <p>At OFFicial, we believe in being a vital ally for people forced to leave behind their homes, lives, and everything they know, often facing precarious conditions upon arriving in a new country. We understand that the journey to stability can be filled with uncertainty, and our mission is to make that journey smoother and more predictable.</p>
            <h3>What Do We Do?</h3>
            <p>We use innovation and prospective design to create future-oriented artifacts that promote collective reflection and drive social change. Our work focuses on transforming refugees' complex realities into effective solutions for the near future.</p>
            <h3>Look & Feel</h3>
            <p>The development of the graphic elements that make up Welcome is based on two fundamental guidelines: the design principles by which OFFicial operates and the work developed by Syrian graphic designer and refugee Yara Said. In 2015, one of the largest migration crises in history unfolded, with the civil war in Syria, extreme poverty in Niger, and political persecution in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
