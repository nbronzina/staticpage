              <h3>Project Viability</h3>
    <p><strong>Technical Viability</strong></p>
    <p>At OFFicial, we follow the path of Responsible Design because:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It is seen as a means for sustainability.</li>
        <li>It minimizes the risk of products becoming obsolete.</li>
        <li>Using carefully selected materials reduces environmental impact.</li>
        <li>It is designed for longer durability.</li>
        <li>It is an innovation based on recycled and higher-quality materials, contributing to both carbon and waste footprint reduction for the planet.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>OFFicial considers applying Modular Design to its products important because:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Conventional design is still too complex and unsuitable for creating a portfolio of different product versions.</li>
        <li>With modular design, any current market product can be adapted without restarting the manufacturing process.</li>
        <li>Modularity provides agility, helping to avoid large amounts of obsolete inventory whenever the market changes.</li>
        <li>It is more consumer/user-friendly as they do not face total replacement; they can easily replace the broken module.</li>
        <li>It fosters a broader customer/user base.</li>
        <li>Aesthetic customization (as long as they like the overall design language, it can be easily modified to fit anyone's personal style).</li>
        <li>Product confidence. They do not waste the money invested in it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Not every hardware product suits this approach (e.g., thin and lightweight designs like smartphones), but complexity can be managed. With the design features of OFFicial's wearable, modularity works because it is still relatively simple and manageable.</p>
    <p>We are not looking for the impossible but to do things well, one at a time.</p>
    <p>A design based on both longevity (responsibility) and modularity can extend the functional lifespan of the wearable.</p>

    <h3>Economic Viability</h3>
    <p>Another validation point is economic, and at OFFicial, we believe Welcome's stakeholders and partners are excellent business options:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google</strong> with its "Impact Challenge," providing support to non-profit organizations and community social initiatives to make society a better place together; referencing the 2018 Google AI Impact Challenge.</li>
        <li><strong>SkillLab BV</strong> (Netherlands), discovered based on the previous partner. They help municipal employment services integrate refugees into local jobs. Using an AI-powered app, refugees can quickly document their skills in their native languages and receive relevant career path recommendations to explore.</li>
        <li><strong>Solferino Academy</strong>. It aims to challenge and inspire how people work, think, act, and connect. It supports the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) network in transforming for the future, thriving through complex and dynamic changes. The IFRC can better address upcoming humanitarian and development challenges by doing so. The Academy partners with the private sector, academic institutions, entrepreneurs, startups, and others with similar values.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Legal Viability</h3>
    <p>In terms of legal viability, since Welcome's set of information and data is considered confidential or in high-risk environments, its security and protection are of utmost importance for both OFFicial and all involved actors, relying on the primary attribute of digital identification systems:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Flexibility and durability in operation (e.g., in a natural disaster and/or migration).</li>
        <li>Using Biometrics, one of the principles sought by the design team was for the wearable to comply with the principle of being counterfeit-resistant. This means ensuring that it is difficult to fake, providing security to the user.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The type of identification included in our device is based on a security methodology, allowing the recognition of our users' non-transferable physical characteristics for identification. This increases the security of the second system, ensuring no vulnerabilities in the security.</p>
    <p>These applications aim for more convenient systems (easier presentation of identification and documentation), more secure (only authorized individuals have access), and faster (reduced maintenance of codes).</p>
    <p>OFFicial's biometric system is overseen by a public official and NGO workers during the registration (NGO) and verification (State) of asylum seekers' identities in the database. Civil identification aims to prevent multiple registrations and duplicates, following the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) conditions for biometric data transfer to the State.</p>
    <p>Therefore, Welcome will guarantee data protection, collecting only what is necessary and deleting it once the asylum process and evaluation are complete. This ensures that migrants and refugees can live without fear, connecting with the host community and inviting them to participate.</p>
